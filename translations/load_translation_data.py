# TODO
"""
- Loop through and replace text in deserialised json instead of replacing values in string.
- Ignore any text between '<' and '>' and '{' and '}'.
- Sort out the loop for string replacement. There's got to be a better way of doing it than this!
- Find a way to remove all hardcoding. Can these be held globally in a properties file?
- Do we need to worry about ordering of JSON output?
- Add/amend other team/best practice stuff that's been missed out.
- Will this be run from command line or called from another script for now? Guard against different inputs.
